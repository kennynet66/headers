# IMPLEMENTATION OF C FUNCTIONS

This is how I have made my own implementation of some c functions:

- _strlen ( using for loop)
- _strlen ( using Recursion)
- _puts_recursion
- _pow_recursion
- _putchar
- _strcmp
- _strcat
- factorial
- _puts_rev (Prints strings in reverse)

# What is included

I have included a [test.c](test.c) file to test the functions
